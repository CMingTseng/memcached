# LevelDB in Java

This is a rewrite (port) of [Memcached](http://http://memcached.org/) in
Java.  This goal was to have a feature complete implementation that is within
10% of the performance of the C original.

# Current status

I started working on this a few years ago and got the slab allocator and hash
working, but life being as it is, I never finished the protocol port.  If there
is general interest in this project, I'd we willing to pick it up again and
finish it.
